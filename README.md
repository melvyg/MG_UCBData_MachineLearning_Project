Marvel Universe Spheres of Influence

Overview
The goal of this project is to identify marvel characters with the largest comic influence or social status--use k-means clustering define and visualize different marvel universes and the connections between these universes. Important parameters to consider to define clusters include: co-occurrence between characters. I aim to create an interactive D3.js visualization to illustrate how k-means is implemented and how the marvel character clusters are defined. Also, for fun, a D3.js force-directed cluster chart
